# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google Learn Guide

5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course was a live event from March 31st to April 4th 2025.

## :scroll: Course Contents

- **Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering** - Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

- **Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases** - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

- **Day 3: Generative AI Agents** - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

- **Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs** - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

- **Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI** - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications
